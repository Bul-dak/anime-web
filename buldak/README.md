Project Details.

- Users will be able to see the top 10 anime titles.
- Users will be able to see details about each anime title.
- Users can receive a random anime recommendation or a tailored suggestion based on specific criteria.
- Users can receive anime recommendations based on their search, highlighting similar titles (e.g., searching - "Pok√©mon" will suggest "Digimon").

New Feature ideas:

- Users will be able to switch between dark mode and light mode.
  I will render the darkmode-lightmode buttons manually using the html files, css-helpers.js create functions to give our buttons the right type of event listener and the desired effect which is to toggle the CSS accordingly.

- make sure to add a light mode for the rest of the pages
